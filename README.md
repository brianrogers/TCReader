TCReader
========

TCReader is an iOS app that allows viewing and annotating of a PDF file with TinCanAPI/ExperienceAPI statements. You can download a PDF from a URL to the device and comment on each page.

This is purely an example and not meant to be a full application. I built it over a weekend to show what could be done with the new API.

##Installation

  pod install
  
Open with XCode and update AppDelegate.m with LRS url and auth.

##License

TCReader is built with a few other open source contributions pieced together. The app code is MIT licensed but other parts may have other licenses as listed in the header files.

##Acknowledgments

TCReader uses the open source TinCanObjC library - http://github.com/RusticiSoftware/TinCanObjC
