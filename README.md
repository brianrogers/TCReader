TCReader
========

TCReader is an iOS app that allows viewing and annotating of a PDF file with TinCanAPI/ExperienceAPI statements. You can download a PDF from a URL to the device and comment on each page.

This is purely an example and not meant to be a full application. I built it over a weekend to show what could be done with the new API.

##Installation

  pod install
  
Open with XCode and update AppDelegate.m with LRS url and auth.
